Bike Token

 Bike is a token I (fredcat) airdropped to all Velo lockers.  This token is a novelty that has a 0.75% tax both coming and going.  The developer will use half of the tax revenue to buy and lock Velo to vote for Bike pool.  The other half of the tax revenue will go to improving the livelihood of cyclists around the world.  Whether that means buying bikes for those in need or sponsoring proffesional teams.  This is an experiment with the potential to improve the lives of others while also supporting the Velo ecosystem.  

 50% of the supply was airdropped to lockers.  The other half was sent to an address to be used for marketing/developing but mostly to bribe the Bike pool.  We need to bribe in order to attract liquidity providers.
